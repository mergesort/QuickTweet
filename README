This is a mobile substrate tweak that adds a little button to the Notification Center.  When pressed, it presents a modal view for tweeting.  It requires iOS 5, since it lives in the Notification Center.

I don't know what license this falls under, but I'll give it my best shot to clarify.

Feel free to steal and use code as you please, but if you plan to release something competing, just give me a heads up beforehand at jfabisevich@me.com and we'll discuss that possibility.
